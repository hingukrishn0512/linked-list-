# Understanding Linked List in Python

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a **Singly Linked List** using classes and objects. It is designed to help beginners understand how linked lists work by using `Node` and `next`.

---

## What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a **node**) contains:
- **Data**
- A reference to the **next node**

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory, allowing efficient insertion and deletion.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Creating a `Node` class
- Linking nodes using `next`
- Traversing the list
- Inserting new nodes
- Displaying all nodes
